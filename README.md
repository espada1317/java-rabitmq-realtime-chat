# java-rabitmq-realtime-chat
sandbox project for enhancing knowledge of asynchronous communication

# Project Overview: Real-Time Chat Application
### Objectives:
Implement a Real-Time Chat System: Users should be able to send and receive messages instantly.
Use Java for Backend Development: Leverage Java's robustness for server-side logic.
Utilize RabbitMQ for Message Handling: Implement RabbitMQ to manage message queues efficiently.

### Key Features:
User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to register and log in.
Individual and Group Chats: Enable one-on-one and group messaging.
Message Status Indicators: Show statuses like sent, delivered, and read.
Persistent Message Storage: Store messages in a database for history retrieval.
Real-Time Notifications: Implement notifications for new messages.

### Technical Requirements:
Backend: Java (Spring Boot or similar framework).
Message Broker: RabbitMQ.
Database: SQL (like PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (like MongoDB) for storing messages and user data.
Frontend (Optional): A simple UI using a framework like React or Angular, or a mobile app using Flutter or React Native.
APIs: RESTful or WebSocket for real-time communication.

### Tasks Breakdown:
1. Setup and Basic Configuration
   Initialize a Java project with a chosen framework (like Spring Boot).
   Set up RabbitMQ on your local machine or use a cloud-based service.
   Configure basic connection between Java backend and RabbitMQ.
2. User Management
   Implement user registration and authentication (consider using JWT for token-based authentication).
   Create database schemas for user data.
3. Messaging System
   Design the message model and database schema for storing messages.
   Implement RabbitMQ queues and exchanges for handling real-time messages.
   Develop services in Java for sending and receiving messages through RabbitMQ.
4. Real-Time Communication
   Establish WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
   Integrate WebSocket with RabbitMQ to push messages to connected clients.
5. Group Chat Functionality
   Implement functionality to create group chats and add participants.
   Manage message broadcasting in groups through RabbitMQ.
6. Message Status and Notifications
   Implement logic for message status updates (sent, delivered, read).
   Set up real-time notifications for new messages using RabbitMQ.
7. Frontend Development (Optional)
   Create basic interfaces for user registration, login, message sending, and viewing.
   Connect the frontend with the backend using RESTful APIs or WebSockets.
8. Testing
   Perform unit and integration testing, particularly focusing on the reliability of message delivery and system responsiveness.
9. Deployment
   Deploy the backend service and RabbitMQ on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
   (If applicable) Deploy the frontend application.

### Additional Considerations:
   Scalability: Ensure the design is scalable to handle an increasing number of users and messages.
   Security: Implement security best practices, especially for user data and communication channels.
   Error Handling: Robust error handling and logging for both the Java backend and RabbitMQ interactions.
